| RTO-T29 | 2026-10-26 | fix | closed | Suppression: a push draws a shot for every square crossed instead of one, because the target has no command of its own | e944409 |

| RTO-T53 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | AbilityCasterHasWeaponWithRangeType crashes (NullReferenceException) for a caster with any empty additional limb, greying out all three abilities; confirmed on Pasqal (mechadendrites) | commit f52f1c3 |

| RTO-T56 | 2026-10-29 | feature | closed | A yellow LineRenderer outline traces the boundary of an active Reflex Shot circle or Overwatch cone, since the game's shared red area highlight is hard to see | commit f52f1c3 |
| RTO-T57 | 2026-10-29 | chore | closed | Build prints the installed DLL's last-write time after every deploy, so it's obvious whether a restart will pick up stale or current code | commit f52f1c3 |

| RTO-T59 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | Overwatched debuff shows on enemies only while casting, then disappears; only the caster keeps an icon | commit f52f1c3 |
| RTO-T60 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | Reflex Shot circle stays 10 cells regardless of the weapon's range (RTO-T55 not taking effect, tooltip still says 10) | commit f52f1c3 |
| RTO-T61 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | Yellow outline (RTO-T56) never draws, during preview or after cast | commit f52f1c3 |
| RTO-T62 | 2026-10-29 | feature | closed | Reflex Shot: circle radius = the weapon's full range (no 10-cell ceiling), with a distance aim penalty scaling to -33 at full range | commit f52f1c3 |

| RTO-T67 | 2026-10-29 | feature | closed | Taking any damage interrupts the unit's Suppression, Overwatch and Reflex Shot; cosmetic suppression fire shoots projectiles at the target that deliver nothing | commit f52f1c3 |

| RTO-T71 | 2026-10-29 | feature | wont-do | While aiming Overwatch or Reflex Shot, show each enemy inside the area its projected hit chance, including our modifiers | superseded by RTO-T80 (overtip gauge instead of custom labels) |

| RTO-T73 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | Bughunt: exhaustive sweep of the mod's source, blueprints and localization; fix every confirmed bug | fixed in src/RogueTrader.Overwatch/ReflexShot.cs: ReflexShot_AimModifier never cleared ReflexShot.Pending after a successful match, so a later unrelated attack on the same target within 5s inherited Reflex Shot's base hit chance, damage cut and stale aim modifier |
| RTO-T74 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | Bughunt pass 2: review the pass-1 fixes, cross-patch interactions, save/load and uninstall safety, design-doc consistency | reviewed RTO-T73's fix for correctness, cross-patch Harmony priority ordering, save/load and uninstall safety, design-doc consistency; nothing further found |

| RTO-T77 | 2026-10-29 | fix | wont-do | Hit-chance labels overlap the game's overhead unit icon: raise them above it and use a smaller font | superseded by RTO-T80: no custom label exists to reposition, game's own overtip gauge is used |
| RTO-T78 | 2026-10-29 | fix | wont-do | Hit-chance labels use the game's own hit-percentage text colour instead of a red-to-green gradient | superseded by RTO-T80: no custom label exists to recolor, game's own overtip gauge is used |
| RTO-T79 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | Bughunt: enemy AI ignores off-hand ranged weapons; drop temporary diag logging and unused LockedRadius | commits 6869221 9ea8b85 1a3c33e 84b99df |
| RTO-T80 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | Hit-chance preview: labels off-centre and unlike the game's hit-chance UI; show above the overwatch target icon in the game's own style | commits 6869221 9ea8b85 1a3c33e 84b99df |
| RTO-T81 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | Suppression's cosmetic shots fly into the target; aim them at points around it so they always visibly miss | commits 6869221 9ea8b85 1a3c33e 84b99df |

| RTO-T84 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | Suppression red line only for weapons with no projectile to fire (e.g. Pasqal's staff); projectile weapons rely on their missing cosmetic shots instead | commits 6869221 9ea8b85 1a3c33e 84b99df |
| RTO-T85 | 2026-10-29 | feature | closed | Overwatch shots are attacks of opportunity, so AoO talents and bonuses apply | commits 6869221 9ea8b85 1a3c33e 84b99df |

| RTO-T91 | 2026-10-29 | feature | closed | Overwatch is the next best thing to a direct shot: shots = AP left after paying its own cost / attack cost (1 to 2), so it never matches shooting directly | commits 6869221 9ea8b85 1a3c33e 84b99df |
| RTO-T92 | 2026-10-29 | fix | closed | Spanish Overwatch description: use 'que te quedarían' for consistent tense | commits 6869221 9ea8b85 1a3c33e 84b99df |
